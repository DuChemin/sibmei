Sibmei
======

A Sibelius plugin for writing and reading MEI files in Sibelius.

Installation
------------

To install this plugin, copy or symlink the `.plg` files into the appropriate Sibelius plugin directory on your machine. The specific location [depends on your OS and version of Sibelius](http://www.sibelius.com/download/plugins/index.html?help=install).

Usage
------------

Due to the restrictions of Sibelius plugins, post-processing may be required. [libmei](https://github.com/DDMAL/libmei) provides support for writing straight-forward Python scripts to edit MEI files.
