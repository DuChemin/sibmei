Usage
------------

Under the “Home” tab of the Sibelius ribbon, select the “Plug-ins” button at the far right. sibmei’s plugins are labelled and grouped together. “Export file to MEI” and “Export folder to MEI” are the two functions intended for general use; the latter is useful for exporting many files at once, and may take a while to complete running if there are many files in your folder.
